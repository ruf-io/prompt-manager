- Use `beforeEach(createDB)` and `afterEach(resetDB)` for reliable test setup
- Create prerequisite data first (users, categories) before dependent records
- Include ALL fields in test inputs, even those with Zod defaults
- Test numeric conversions: verify `typeof result.price === 'number'`
- Use flexible error assertions: `expect().rejects.toThrow(/pattern/i)`
- NEVER use mocks - always test against real database operations
- Keep handlers fully isolated - don't use other handlers in tests
- For foreign key tests, verify referenced entities exist first
- Test both success and error cases for database constraints
